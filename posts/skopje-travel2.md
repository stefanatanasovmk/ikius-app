After a short city holiday in Plovdiv and hiking in Balkan Mountains and in Seven Rila Lakes in Bulgaria, it was time to move on to **Rebublic of Macedonia**. We have traveled in the south-western part of the country on our short Balkan tour in 2012 but didn’t see the capital at all back then. So we decided to go there now, and spend couple of weeks in Skopje.

We crossed the Bulgaria – North Macedonia border in Obel-Delchevo late in one Tuesday evening. The road towards the border was so quiet, that we started to doubt if the crossing is open at all. Luckily it was, and after a short stop, basically just showing our passports and registration document of the car, we entered in North Macedonia.

**EXPECTATIONS AGAINST REALITY**

Since it was so late, we stayed the night in the small town of Delchevo near the border, and then drove to Skopje next morning. To get some kind picture of the city beforehand, we read an old Macedonia guide book from 2007 on the way. We learned that back in 1963 the city suffered huge losses in a disastrous earthquake that killed over thousand, injured much more, destroyed most of the city and left 70 % of the population without home. This devastating incident led to quick reconstruction to get the city back on its feet. Once full of historical and handsome neoclassical buildings, the new face of the city center was dominated by concrete buildings and modernist architecture with communist and brutalist style landmarks.

As the guide book stated that ”Skopje is not anyone’s idea of an architectural gem” and that “there really aren’t that much sights in the new town”, we didn’t expect much of it. Target of our walking tour was mainly to see the interesting, brutalist style buildings like the main post office, visit the Skopje Fortress and wander around the bazaar streets in the so-called old town across the Vardar river that runs through the city. With these presumptions, we were totally bowled over when arriving at the central square by the river, called the **Macedonia Square**.
